            <h1>What are Landslides?</h1>
            <p>Landslides are abrupt movements of rock, soil, and debris down slopes, often triggered by factors like heavy rainfall or human activities. 
                These events pose risks to communities, infrastructure, and the environment, potentially causing loss of life, property damage, and 
                disruption of transportation routes. Implementing measures such as slope stabilization and early warning systems is crucial for mitigating
                the impacts of landslides and protecting vulnerable areas from their destructive effects.</p>
            
            <h2>How to Survive a Landslide</h2>
            <p>Landslides happen fast and can be dangerous, especially in areas with rain or shakes.
            Stay ready by keeping an eye on the weather and knowing your surroundings. Pack a simple emergency kit with basics like water and first aid.
            If there's a landslide warning, move to higher ground ASAP, avoiding valleys. Stay safe and be prepared!</p>
                
                

            <h2>How to Prepare for a Tsunami</h2>

            <p>Consider these steps before, during, and after a landslide:</p>

            <h3>Before a Landslide</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Avoid constructing structures in proximity to steep slopes, mountain edges, drainage ways, or natural erosion valleys.</li>
                <li>Obtain a thorough assessment of the ground conditions on your property.</li>
                <li>Observe the flow patterns of storm-water drainage near your residence, identifying convergence points that intensify runoff during storms. Steer clear of these areas during adverse weather conditions.</li>
                <li>Familiarize yourself with the emergency-response and evacuation strategies in place for your locality. Create a personalized emergency plan for your family or business.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>During a Landslide</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Stay alert during a landslide threat, especially if you're in bed, as debris-flow incidents often happen when people are asleep.
                    Use a Radio or battery-powered radio/TV for heavy rainfall warnings. Be cautious of intense, short bursts of rain, especially after prolonged wet weather.</li>
                <li>If in landslide-prone areas, consider leaving safely. Driving during heavy storms is risky; if at home, move to a second story if possible to avoid debris flow paths.</li>
                <li>Listen for unusual sounds like trees cracking or rocks colliding, as these may signal moving debris. Watch for small trickles of mud or debris, which can precede larger landslides.</li>
                <li>Drive carefully, as bridges may be compromised and culverts overflowed. Never cross flooded streams.
                    Watch for collapsed pavement, mud, rocks, and signs of potential debris flows along roadsides.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>After a Landslide</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Stay clear of the slide area to avoid the risk of additional slides.</li>
                <li>Tune in to local radio or TV stations for the latest emergency updates.</li>
                <li>Be vigilant for potential flooding, which may occur post-landslide or debris flow. Landslides and floods can be triggered by the same event.</li>
                <li>Refrain from entering the direct slide area, but check for injured and trapped individuals near the slide. Guide rescuers to their locations.</li>
                <li>Report any broken utility lines and damaged roads or railways to the relevant authorities promptly.
                    Swift reporting helps in shutting off utilities swiftly, preventing further hazards and injuries.</li>
